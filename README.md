# Theories-for-disordered-proteins-and-phase-seperation
My 2020 summer research program was conducted under the supervision of Professor Zhang Zhuqing from Department of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. The topic is biological condensates and phase seperation.

* Physical models and simulation

The program mainly includes literature reading, online meetings and presentations. Because I majored in both biology and physics, my part mainly focused on the physical models for phase seperation and disordered proteins. My reading materials included reviews, research papers, and textbooks (listed in my program report).
The most useful textbook was Polymer Physics By Michael Rubinstein, Ralph H. Colby.

This knowledge would be helpful as we planed to set up computer simulation models later.

* Database and prediction

Professor Zhang's team also set up and mainteins LLPSDB, a database of proteins undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro.

Following work might concern making predictions based on our own data. Incorporation of machine learning algorithms is being considered.

* My learning notes

I uploaded my learning notes, presentation slides and my program report for the summer.
